### Introduction
Hey my name is Noah.  I am a student at the University of Iowa and I am studying BAIS and Marketing in the Tippie School of Business.  I am a Junior and hoping to get an internship this summer.

### Branches
You can use branches and pull requests to edit repositories so if you make a mistake or want someone else to check over your work, you can compare the original and the edited version.  It's always smart to make a branch instead of commiting on the main document.

### Markdown Syntax
Using Markdown Syntax is very important for achieving readibility in your repositiories and organizing them well.  Using different headings, **bold text**, *italicized text*, and other options can calrify and emphasize things.
