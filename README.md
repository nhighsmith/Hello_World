### Introduction
Hey my name is Noah.  I am a student at the University of Iowa and I am studying BAIS and Marketing in the Tippie School of Business.  I am a Junior and hoping to get an internship this summer.


### Branches
You can use branches and pull requests to edit repositories so if you make a mistake or want someone else to check over your work, you can compare the original and the edited version.  It also allows use to go back to past branches and see what you started with which can help find any potential errors.  It's always smart to make a branch instead of commiting on the main document.


### Markdown Syntax
Using Markdown Syntax is very important for achieving readibility in your repositiories and organizing them well.  Using different headings, **bold text**, *italicized text*, and other options can clarify and emphasize things.  Click this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to go to a guide on markdown syntax.


### Learning Courses
If you are looking for more information and tutorials on how to use Github, there are lots of videos out there.  You can go through LinkedIn learning, Github itself has tutorials and help guides you can use, and there are also plenty of youtube videos to help you find your way.


### Extra Files
If you use any data files for a project you are working on, make sure to include a section detailing what they are and how you used them.  Include where you got them, what they included, and it's also good to link the original data so others can check it out for themselves and you can go back to it as well as needed.  It's easy to attach files to GitHub.
